# Decisions

Smaller decisions made during implementation, one dated line each; larger ones become an
[ADR](adr/).

- 2026-11-10: CI skips a job whose paths a pull request does not touch. `scripts/ci-changes.sh`
  maps the changed files (GitHub API, no deep checkout) to the groups `markdown`, `php`, `ts` and
  `app`; an unknown path or a push to `main` turns everything on, so a skip is never a guess.
- 2026-11-10: The single required check is `CI gate`. It always runs and fails only when a job
  failed or was cancelled, so a skipped job counts as passed and the merge gate keeps every check.
  Each new CI job (PHP, TypeScript, build, e2e) joins the gate's `needs` and takes its group's
  `if:` from `changes`.
- 2026-11-10: REUSE lint always runs, because any new file can lack a header; it takes seconds.
- 2026-11-10: Superseded runs of the same pull request are cancelled (`concurrency` in `ci.yml`,
  never on `main`).
- 2026-11-10: One setup per toolchain instead of one per tool: a `PHP` job per version runs
  php-cs-fixer (8.3 only, formatting does not depend on the version), psalm and PHPUnit after a
  single `composer install`, and one `TypeScript` job runs eslint, tsc and Vitest after a single
  `npm ci`. Ten jobs become five, and a failing step still names the tool.
- 2026-11-10: Composer's download cache is kept with `actions/cache` keyed on `composer.lock`; npm
  uses `setup-node`'s `cache: npm`. The first run after a lock change refills them.
- 2026-11-10: Build and e2e (M2.1) take the `app` group and join the gate's `needs`.
- 2026-11-10: (measurement only, not merged)
